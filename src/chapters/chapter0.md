## Introduction

Welcome to the NativeScript Workshop!

To get started you'll need the following pre-requisites:

* Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
* [GenyMotion emulator](https://www.genymotion.com/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) open-source full-hardware virtualizer
* Visual Studio Code (or other text editor or IDE)
* [NativeScript](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup) v2.1 installed and configured

### About NativeScript

[NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) is a framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS. NativeScript renders UIs with the native platform’s rendering engine, no WebViews, resulting in native-like performance and UX.

NativeScript provides a best-of-both-worlds development experience. Our cross-platform JavaScript modules give you the convenience of writing iOS and Android apps from a single JavaScript code base, while our runtimes give you the power of accessing native APIs, SDKs, and frameworks when you need them—all without needing to open Xcode or Android Studio. NativeScript was created and is supported by Telerik.

### What you're building

In this workshop you'll learn how to build iOS and Android mobile apps using NativeScript. Throughout the workshop, you'll be building 2 apps: the mobile app version of an online vintage video game reseller (Tekmo) and a text-to-speech soundboard app. 

Key concepts and take aways:

* NativeScript app architecture
* Using the NativeScript CLI (command line interface) tools
  * Creating and scaffolding apps
  * Building apps
  * Running apps in an emulator
* Pages
* Navigation
* Basic UI elements (labels, buttons, text boxes, etc.)
* Organizing your UI with layouts
* Styling your app with CSS
* Data binding
* Using plugins

### Where to learn more

The first place you can go to learn more about NativeScript is by reading my book, [NativeScript in Action](http://bit.ly/nsinaction), from Manning Press.

### Inspirations

A portion of this workshop was inspired by a [fun weekend project](https://brosteins.com/2016/03/26/nativescript-mobile-app-kids/) my son and I built. We're really into building robots right now, so we built a carboard robot with his tablet as the head. I ended up writing a quick NativeScript soundboard app so the robot could talk back to him.
